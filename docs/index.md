# qbin
A minimalist pastebin service. Includes a nice and easy Netcat and POST API, and can render Markdown.

### Â» [See it in action](https://qbin.io/)

## Features
- Simple UI that works with all browsers (including lynx)  
  JavaScript is not required, but adds nice features like:
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Holding Ctrl+V for approximately a second directly submits the document
  - Syntax highlighting in the editor
  - Improved syntax mode selection
  - Drag & Drop text or a text file to insert it
  - Some more stuff I probably forgot about
- Full syntax highlighting on documents, also without JavaScript
- Simple and flexible API using HTTP or TCP/netcat
- Render colors from ANSI escape sequences (`dmesg --color=always | nc qbin.io 90`)
